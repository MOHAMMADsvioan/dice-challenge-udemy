# dice-challenge-udemy
i studied it " The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp'  ,this is one of the challenges in the course,  and it's two dices at the screen and each time you refresh the page each one of these dices gets a different number and and the dice with the highest number wins, just a cool little challenge to practice js and DOM manipulation for biggenrs
